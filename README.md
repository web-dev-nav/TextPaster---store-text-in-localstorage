The app allows users to enter a heading and associated text. This way, users can add important data and have it later on. Some use cases are: storing login information, notes, etc. When the "Save Text" button is clicked, the entered text is saved to the browser's local storage and retain their even after page refresh and never expired until you delete or clear cookies. Moreover, If the heading already exists, the existing entry is updated; otherwise, a new entry is added.
Overall, the Text Storage App is a simple productivity tool that allows users to save, edit, and download their text entries with headings, facilitating better organization and access to important information.
